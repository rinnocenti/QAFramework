# ADR-004B Camera Negative Integrity QA

Status: **CERTIFIED — 18/18**  
Last updated: **2026-08-10**

## Purpose

Certify the negative and transactional integrity boundaries required by
`IF-ADR-004B — Camera Negative Integrity Certification` without creating a
parallel Camera runtime.

The regression reuses the canonical C9R Camera Override Authority lifecycle for
real Activity/Route evidence and existing Camera authoring regressions for
persistent-output validation.

## Source provenance

Original QA authoring bases:

```text
QAFramework
  f4ce36335878113e4b64e79d337c0645f6499707

com.immersive.framework
  bbaf05dbc7442290de8916fe312acd77a11f2b58
```

Current repository heads at documentation closure:

```text
QAFramework

  Cam-Pass

com.immersive.framework
  baecd612c79fe4dabfde5be8d7cf17f3b6b4a3ea
  Adr004
```

The final 004B log intentionally distinguishes its package base from the applied
`IF-ADR-004C` package patch.

## Setup

Use the existing Camera setup. 004B adds no setup, scene, fixture, context,
service or output authority.

```text
Immersive Framework > QA > Setup > Camera >
Install Camera Override Authority QA
```

## Execution

1. Enter Play Mode from QA Hub.
2. Run `Camera Override Authority`.
3. Wait for C9R to return to Hub and emit its 11-case PASS.
4. Stay in the same Play Mode session.
5. Run:

```text
Immersive Framework > QA > Regressions > Camera >
Run ADR-004B Negative Integrity Certification
```

Cases 14-16 consume C9R evidence from that same Play Mode session. Missing C9R
evidence blocks those delegated cases rather than assuming them.

## Matrix ownership

```text
01-13  QaCameraAdr004BNegativeIntegrityRegression
14     canonical C9R Activity lifecycle cleanup
15     canonical C9R Route lifecycle cleanup + Session survivor preservation
16     focused C9R abnormal Route-owner disable probe
17     QaPersistentCameraPresentationCompositionRegression
18     QaCameraOutputSessionBindingAuthoringRegression
```

Cases 11-13 use deterministic fixture-controlled invalid rig state to prove
physical apply rollback and explicit rollback failure without adding a production
fault-injection service.

## Case 15 evidence boundary

Route cleanup owns the Route request only. The C9R proof requires:

```text
Route request absent
+ synthetic Session survivor still admitted
+ winner remains arbitration-owned
```

It deliberately does not require the synthetic survivor to be the winner because
the persistent Session Camera may legitimately be republished during transition
and win by precedence.

The earlier `winner == synthetic survivor` assertion was a QA false negative and
was removed without changing package behavior.

## Case 16 history

The first valid owner-loss probe reproduced:

```text
[QA_CAMERA_ADR004B]
case='16-abnormal-owner-loss'
operation='DisableRouteOwner'
admittedBefore='2'
admittedAfter='2'
orphan='True'
```

That result correctly prevented certification and opened:

```text
IF-ADR-004C — Camera Owner Lifetime Integrity
```

The package was then hardened at the scoped publication/component lifetime
boundary. 004B was not weakened to hide the failure.

## Final certification

After the 004C package correction:

```text
[CAMERA_RUNTIME_HOST_INTEGRATION_REGRESSION]
status='Passed'
cases='11'

[QA_CAMERA_ADR004C]
status='Passed'
cases='10/10'
failed='0'

[QA_CAMERA_ADR004B]
status='Passed'
cases='18/18'
failed='0'
blocked='0'
packagePatch='IF-ADR-004C'
verdict='ADR-004B CAMERA NEGATIVE INTEGRITY CERTIFIED'
```

Case 16 now reports:

```text
admittedBefore='2'
admittedAfter='1'
orphan='False'
```

## What 004B certifies

- deterministic precedence and tie-break behavior;
- duplicate RequestId and wrong OutputId blocking;
- repeated Publish/Release idempotence;
- winner restoration and out-of-order release;
- admission/release physical-apply rollback;
- explicit rollback failure;
- normal Activity/Route cleanup;
- abnormal Route owner loss without orphaning;
- duplicate persistent output validation;
- invalid output reference validation;
- no fallback Camera authority introduced by QA.

## Post-certification teardown hygiene

After all functional gates were green, scene teardown exposed one QA-only
synthetic Local Player cleanup issue: its local publisher could attempt a second
release after the request had already disappeared from the output context.

The v10 QA cleanup patch reconciles that local synthetic state before redundant
release. It does not alter any 004B case or package behavior. A clean-log rerun of
that teardown hygiene patch had not yet been supplied when this document was
updated.

## Verdict

```text
ADR-004B
  CERTIFIED 18/18

Product defect discovered by initial case 16
  RESOLVED by IF-ADR-004C

Current Camera negative-integrity blocker
  NONE for accepted single-output boundary
```
