Canonical planning entry point:

```

Accepted architectural decisions:

```text
ADRs/ADR-INDEX.md
```

F0-F13 are closed/applied. The next planned phase is F14: `Local/Object Reset Foundation`.

Current reset boundary:

```text
Cycle Reset is Route/Activity reset only.
Object Reset, Component Reset, Player Reset and physical Unity reset adapters are future phases.
```

Cycle Reset authoring note:

```text
RouteCycleResetTrigger and ActivityCycleResetTrigger are the primary components.
Unity Event Bridges are optional and are only needed for Inspector/UnityEvent callbacks.
```

Closed Object Entry boundary:

```text
Object Entry is a passive lifecycle-owned logical catalog/snapshot.
It is not GameObject binding, Object Reset, a mutable registry or a service locator.
Route/Activity owners, scoped collection and snapshot lifecycle were closed in F13.
```
